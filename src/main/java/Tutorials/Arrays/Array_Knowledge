Create Arrays:

Datatype arrayName[] = new Datatype[size];
Arrays are static means once we have declared a array size it cannot be changed later on.

how to take inputs from the array
arrayelement  = sc.nextInt();
Eg : marks[0] = sc.nextInt(); //here sc is scanner object

//Passing Array as Argument
In Java , Arrays are reference data types so we can pass arrays from multiple functions and it will be just modifying the actual array.

In case of Linear search the time complexity is O(n)
